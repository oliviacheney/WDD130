        <h2>Olivia Cheney</h2>
        <p>Hi! My name is Olivia Cheney and I am from Northern Virginia, about 45 minutes from Washington D.C. I have lived there all my life and love it so much because it gets to be so green in the Spring and Summer months. Unfortunately, I have been cursed with miserable environmental allergies so every time i step outside, I sneeze. It's alright though. The beauty of all of the greenery is worth it!</p>
        <p>I am the fourth of five children. With 3 older sisters and a younger brother, when we all get together, my house can get kinda crazy. For fun I love to longboard and watch shows and movies. I also love to participate in almost any sport, although i'm not an expert at them.</p>
        <p>This is my second semester here at Brigham Young University Idaho and I am currently majoring in Web Design and Development. I don't know much about coding or websites but it sounds really interesting to me and I have been enjoying my beginning programming, databases, and web development classes. I am excited to see what the rest of my semester will look like and to see the new things I will be learning.</p>
